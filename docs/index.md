# fmc-terraform Provider

This provider can be used to manage the FMC configuration.

## Example
```hcl
provider "fmc" {
    fmc_username = "terraform_user"
    fmc_password = "SecurePasswordFromTfvars"
    fmc_host = "10.10.10.2"
    fmc_insecure_skip_verify = false
}
```
**Note** You should use the terraform variables to supply the credentials securely or use the environment variables: `FMC_USERNAME`, `FMC_PASSWORD`, `FMC_HOST`, `FMC_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY`.
