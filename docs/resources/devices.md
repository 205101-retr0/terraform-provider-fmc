  Resource for adding device in FMC
  Example
  An example is shown below:
  hcl
  resource "fmc_devicese" "device1" {
      name = "ftd"
      hostname = "<IP ADDR OF HOST>"
      regkey = "<Reg key used in FTD>"
      metric_value = 22
      type = "Device"
      license_caps = [
          "MALWARE"
      ]
      access_policy {
          id = data.fmc_access_policies.access_policy.id
          type = data.fmc_access_policies.access_policy.type
      }
  }
  
  Note If creating multiple rules during a single terraform apply, remember to use depends_on to chain the rules so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.

# fmc_devices (Resource)

Resource for adding device in FMC

## Example
An example is shown below: 
```hcl
resource "fmc_devicese" "device1" {
    name = "ftd"
    hostname = "<IP ADDR OF HOST>"
    regkey = "<Reg key used in FTD>"
    metric_value = 22
    type = "Device"
    license_caps = [
		"MALWARE"
    ]
    access_policy {
        id = data.fmc_access_policies.access_policy.id
        type = data.fmc_access_policies.access_policy.type
	}

**Note** If creating multiple rules during a single `terraform apply`, remember to use `depends_on` to chain the rules so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.
